# Arduino Tetris
This project required me to build a Physical Computing interface that will react to changes in environment or manipulation by updating a computer-screen, with the focus of using various available sensors. The arduino was required to communicate with the interface environment via the serial port.
This system allows a user to interact a with a browser based HTML5 Tetris game using various arduino sensors.
